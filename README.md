# BookForBook

A book bartering platform where users in the continental USA trade books 1-for-1 — no money changes hands.

## How It Works

1. List books you want to give away (by ISBN) with a condition rating
2. Add books to your want list
3. The system automatically detects mutual matches and exchange rings (up to 5 people)
4. All parties confirm the trade; shipping addresses are revealed only then
5. Ship your book, mark it received, and leave a rating

Verified libraries and bookstores can receive book donations.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Backend | Django 5.x + Django REST Framework |
| Database | PostgreSQL 16 |
| Task queue | Celery + Redis |
| Frontend | React 18 (Vite) as PWA |
| ISBN data | Open Library API |
| Auth | JWT (djangorestframework-simplejwt) |
| File storage | S3-compatible |
| Notifications | Email (SendGrid/AWS SES), optional SMS (Twilio) |

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose
- Python 3.12+
- Node.js 20+

### Backend

```bash
cp .env.example .env          # fill in secrets
docker compose up -d          # start postgres + redis
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py createsuperuser
python manage.py runserver
```

```bash
# Celery worker (separate terminal)
celery -A config worker -l info

# Celery beat scheduler (separate terminal)
celery -A config beat -l info
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Seed development data

```bash
python scripts/seed_data.py
```

## API

All endpoints live under `/api/v1/`. JWT auth is required except for browse/search and public profiles.

| Prefix | Description |
|---|---|
| `auth/` | Register, verify email, login, refresh token, password reset |
| `users/` | Profile, ratings, GDPR export/delete |
| `books/` | ISBN lookup, search |
| `my-books/` | Have-list management |
| `wishlist/` | Want-list management |
| `matches/` | Auto-detected matches; accept/decline |
| `proposals/` | User-initiated trade proposals |
| `trades/` | Shipment tracking, messaging, ratings |
| `donations/` | Institutional donation workflow |
| `institutions/` | Library/bookstore directory |
| `browse/` | Public book discovery, shipping estimates |

## Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

## Key Business Rules

- **1-for-1 only** — every trade is exactly one book in each direction
- **Continental USA only** — shipping addresses validated to continental US states
- **Match capacity** — new users get 1 active match slot; grows to 10 with trading history
- **Address privacy** — shipping addresses are encrypted at rest and revealed only to confirmed trade partners
- **Exchange rings** — the system detects cycles of 3–5 users who can all trade with each other
- **Inactivity** — books are auto-hidden after 3 months of inactivity and restored on next login
